a bowl, paraboloid, your food expenditure cannot exceed your income, least square, People can only buy so much food, Paraboloid, There would be a sharp increase, Paraboloid, use least squares, parabola? It is a parabola for sure, Parabola, Parabola, Least Squared as mentioned may also apply, Because of the span of the points, some line some curve, bell curve, Cone, Not true in reality, When error is the least, log, logistic, There are not a lot of datapoints around the ends, Least distance from data points, Parabola, cannot go to infinity, you want spend too much on food even though you get richer, paraboloid, Paraboloid, Least square? Parabolid, people will only spend so much for food a week, Least square, Paraboloid, not true, least square, least square, The slope turn regular parabolas to infinity, exponential a bit,  Curved upward,straight line,upward curve, upward, straight, upward,upward,upward,upward, curved line,upward,Curved up,Curved up,Upward, least squares, straight line, upward? curved, upward curve,upward, Parabola,upward,Looks exponential a bit, Upward Curve,curved upward,Straight line, upward sloping, A plane? upward curve,Upward sloping straight line, upward, upward straight line,curve,Straight, Straight,Upward sloping straight,curved, parabola, upward sloping,curved line, upward,exponential, upward,curve,upward,upward,straight line,Upward curve, upward, curve, Parabola, because it cancels out, absolute,absolute value, covariance, why this minimization? Sum some of squares,Negative numbers cancel out positives, absolute value, absolute,absolute,absolute, take absolute value, expenses, same height or same strength, It’s like an indifference curve, an inward curve, gene, growth spurts, derivative, because constant price elasticity of demand, omit other factors? grow at different rates, linear? because the correlation between height and strength only explains so much, Physical factors don’t determine age, it should be a curve line, height is related to age but not necessarily, Take a derivative with respect to pi, Height is not equal to age and stamina, If the number we observed is large enough, can we ignore this error? technology, income inequalities,Sustainable Growth, Allocation of resources, Citizen living standard, Income, Poverty, Social problems,Covid19 pandemic, Poverty inequality,Raw material supply, analyze economic issues such as unemployment or inflation, inequality between the global north and the global south,Money growth, Healthy development,Inflation,Social welfare,Wealth gap, Wealth gap,Income inequality,Economic growth, Sustainability, Poverty,inflation rate, or living standard, Government policy about housing problems and wealth unbalance, Unemployment,social issues,Economic growth,nutrition, health, Social issues,inflation,Tax and law, economic growth, Market efficiency,unemployment,Health problem, inflation,sustainable growth, inflation, efficient allocation, Distribution of resources, Climate change, Global income inequality, Hunger,inflation, equality, resources,inflation, Scarcity,inflation,wealth gap, policy change,Environmental economics, economics stability,Tax Policy,Demand and supply, natural disaster impacts,energy sustainability, sustainability, environmental economy, sort of believe climate issues belong to environmental , economists’ field, Prevent Depression, Growth and development, inflation, Covid19 affect, SocialWelfare, Inflation,inflation,tax and inflation, the production and distribution of resources, economic development,Economic growth,development,Inflation
