## Text Analysis

I define the variable "total_count" as the total word counts related to economics for each student. Table 1 gives a summary statistics.

### Table 1: Summary Statistics for "total_count"

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Summary of character counts
library(pander)
pander(summary(chat$total_count), 
       style='rmarkdown' ) 
```

### Figure 1: Histogram for "total_count"

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# histogram
hist(chat$total_count, 
     main = "",
     xlab = "Word total counts",
     ylab = "Frequency")
```
